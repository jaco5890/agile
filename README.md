## Base dependencies

- [fetch](https://reactnative.dev/docs/network) for networking.
- [prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) to type-check our components exposed properties.
- [react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config) to manage envionments.

   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Setup environments
- Environment can be changed by modifying the isProduction located in src/constant/environments.ts

## API calls
- Currently all "api calls" are being mocked and is reading the data from the mockData folder
- There are two folders one being services and the other servicesMock, they have the same api's, and can be implented by simply changing the import

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
